Music Playlist project for msl group recruitment.

Create a responsive web app. It should have an option of registering on the app via Email, Facebook or Google (registering should not be mandatory). A registered user should have a profile with relevant information. The web app should allow the user to create, save, edit, delete and share a music playlist. The URL of the playlist should be such that multiple people can listen to the same playlist in real-time. The playlist should be created by using an existing music streaming app’s API (YouTube, Soundcloud etc.).
 
Judgement criteria:
1.       Simplification of the brief to achieve maximum output
2.       Research on the brief to minimise iterations during the execution period. Research includes identifying user personas, user states, user journeys, site mapping, wire framing etc.
3.       Mobile first design. Design need not be extraordinary but the web app should not just be made to showcase functionality.
4.       Development should follow industry standards. The web app should fare well on Google PageSpeed Insights. Basic security standards should be followed. API’s should be used well, relevant data should be stored to find optimal balance between data storage cost and data mining. Source code should follow OOP.
